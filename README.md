# GplexProject
A suite of utilities for reporting information on G-quadruplexes relative to coding regions and non-aligned regions.

About half of these modules involve file reformatting to fit certain specifications, and the other half actually crunches data on the presence of G4 complexes. To run through the entire pipeline, run Pipeline.py.
